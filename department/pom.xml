The current Java version in the provided code is Java 17. However, the code doesn't include any Java source code, so there is no need to modify it to be compatible with Java 17.

The provided code is a Maven POM (Project Object Model) file, which is used for configuring and managing dependencies in a Maven-based Java project. It specifies the project's metadata, dependencies, build configuration, and other settings. Since it doesn't contain any Java code, there are no language features, standards, or best practices to upgrade or modify.

Therefore, the code remains unchanged and is already compatible with Java 17.
