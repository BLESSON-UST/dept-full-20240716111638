The current Java version that the code is written in cannot be determined purely by analyzing the code provided. The code does not contain any specific language features or syntax that can be used to identify the Java version.

Here's the modified code that is compatible with Java 17:

```java
package com.example.department;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
class DepartmentApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }

}
```

No changes were made to the original code as it already adheres to the best practices and standards of Java 17.
