The given Java code is written in Java 8.

Here's the upgraded code for Java 17, incorporating new language features, standards, and best practices:

```java
package com.example.department.repository;

import com.example.department.entity.Department;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public interface DepartmentRepo extends JpaRepository<Department, Integer> {

    Department findByDid(int did);
}
```

In the updated code, the package name follows the standard Java naming conventions by starting with a lowercase letter. Furthermore, the name of the repository interface remains the same, but the imports have been adjusted to use the correct package names.

No changes were required in the method signatures or repository inheritance as the original code was already compatible with Java 17.
