The provided code appears to be a configuration file for a Java Spring application, rather than actual Java code. It contains properties for configuring various aspects of the application, such as database connection, Eureka service discovery, and server.port.

To upgrade the code to be compatible with Java 17, we don't need to make any changes to this configuration file, as it doesn't contain any Java code. However, if you have a Java class file that corresponds to this configuration, please provide that code so we can analyze and upgrade it accordingly.
